# 2D-Histogram-Filter-CVND
2D-Histogram-Filter-CVND Mini project

 2D Histogram Filter
- Python 3
- related to Monte Carlo Localisation concept
- helpers.py, localizer.py and simulate.py are provided as an existing code base
- a new feature for sensing the 2D environment is added in localizer.py
- an existing bug in the function for move is detected in localizer.py
- the bug is corrected after testing it thoroughly via a well-defined test case
- user description of error is converted to bug testing and correction <br/>

A similar histogram-filter based approach would look something like the following graph.
